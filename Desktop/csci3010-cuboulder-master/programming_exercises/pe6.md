2. Add the [provided](../lectures/9_inheritance_part1/animals/) files to your branch and push these changes to remote.
3. Connect your repo to Travis CI. When new code is pushed to any branch in your repo, your code should be compiled.
-- (do not go on until all group members have completed their first three steps) --  
-- (merge the branch into master) --
4. Create a new branch just for yourself.
5. Implement one new Animal in the files `Animal.h` and `Animal.cpp`. Make sure to instantiate it in your `main.cpp`.
6. Create a PR with your teammates as reviewers.
7. Once the PR has been approved by your team members, merge your branch into master.


Person 2
------
1. Create a new branch in your repository.
2. Create an empty `main.cpp` and push this to your remote branch.

4. Create a new branch just for yourself.
5. Implement one new Animal in the files `Animal.h` and `Animal.cpp`. Make sure to instantiate it in your `main.cpp`.
6. Create a PR with your teammates as reviewers.

Person 3 (if they exist in your group)
------
1. Get the branch that Person 2 created locally.
2. Add a README.md to your repository with your group members names and their roles, then push these changes to remote.
3. Add an icon to your README.md indicating the build status of your repository.
