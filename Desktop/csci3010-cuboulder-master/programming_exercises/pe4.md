PE 4 (git prompt)
==============

Using the materials from lecture on Tuesday ([lecture 5](../lectures/5_bash_terminal/bashrc_starter)), edit your `.bashrc` so that your PS1 (command line prompt) provides the following information on your command line about your git repos (if your working directory is a git repo):
- clean vs. dirty
- (if your branch is ahead of remote) No longer required (9/11 11:32 am) If you are already experienced with git, doing this is recommended
- what branch you are on

Your prompt must use at least 3 different colors. To complete this exercise, turn in your .bashrc file and a screen shot showing your prompt indicating all 3 different states above in a git repo.

For those of you who currently use `zsh` or any other non-bash unix shell--[read about how to change your shell](http://www.peachpit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=659655&seqNum=3) and implement your own PS1 in bash.
