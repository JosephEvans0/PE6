Programming Exercise 1 (`Point`)
==================

For this exercise, you should turn in four files on moodle:

`Point.cc` or `pPint.cpp` (should include function comments)

`Point.h`

`main.cc` or `main.cpp` (should include file comment)

`Makefile`

Your `Point` class will define a 3 dimensional point (a point with an x, y, and z coordinate). It should have getter methods for each coordinate and a method, `Distance`, to calculate the euclidian distance between this `Point` and another.

Your main function should create at least two points, calculate the distance between them, and report their coordinates and the calculated distance to the user.

For your `Makefile`, refer to the posted resources on [Makefiles](../resources.md) and the [example Makefile](../examples/Makefile). Your Makefile should include a target for `make all` and a target for `make clean`.

Refer to the style [guidelines](../concise_style_guide_cpp.md). To receive full credit for this assignment, your code must be commented and must compile on the CS VM.
